Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe (also called Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os, XOX Game) is a very popular childrens pencil and paper game, which is often enjoyed by many adults, as well. Because of its simplicity, the game may seem trivial at first, however, Tic Tac Toe involves its share of analytics and rapidity.
